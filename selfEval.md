# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I'm still struggling with For Statements, and working and learning fast enough to turn assignments in. 

Note-taking is a key to my learning. I am going to make a second version to better organize and utilize them this weekend. There are times that information is conveyed in the morning sessions only by hearing and taking notes at that time. So I'm glad I'm writing things down and that it is encouraged. 

Googling to try to learn has not gone well for me. I've gone to the MDN, mozilla/ developer site and been completely confused by the vast explanations, yet not what I need to understand what we are doing. I've tried to watch some videos, but they are often not that helpful and I don't want to waste time. Other sites also use differnt syntax. One said don't use var, use let.  I have eloquent javascript and javascript for kids in book form. And those have been the most helpful. I'm going to continue to use and read them.
